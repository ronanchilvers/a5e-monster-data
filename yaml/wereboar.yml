A lycanthrope in hybrid or beast form is poisoned while within 10 feet of a living or dried wolfsbane flower that it can smell.

If the boar moves at least 20 feet straight towards the target before the attack, the attack deals an extra 7 (2d6) slashing damage. If the target is a creature, it makes a DC 13 Strength saving throw, falling prone on a failure. If the target is a humanoid, it makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it is cursed with wereboar lycanthropy.' }

combat:
    - { name: 'The boar nearly always fights in hybrid form', desc: "Even if it's trying to hide its identity, it's likely to shift to hybrid form and use Frenzied Tusks when bloodied. It fights in a rage; unless given breathing room to calm down, it fights to the death." }
