On a failure, it becomes infected with a disease. Until this disease is cured, the target is poisoned. While diseased, the target makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw every 24 hours, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure and ending the disease on a success. This hit point maximum reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The target dies if its hit point maximum is reduced to 0.' }
