On a failure, the target takes 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, is stunned until the end of the otyugh's next turn, and is pulled up to 5 feet towards the otyugh. On a success, the target takes half damage." }

On a failure, the target contracts a disease. While diseased, the target is poisoned. The target repeats the saving throw every 24 hours, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure (to a minimum of 1 hit point) and becoming cured on a success. The reduction in hit points lasts until the disease is cured.' }
