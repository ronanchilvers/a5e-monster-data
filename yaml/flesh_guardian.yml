combat:
    - { name: 'A flesh guardian prefers to slam creatures in melee', desc: "When its Lightning Bolt is available, it uses it immediately, without much regard for catching multiple creatures in the blast. It tends to use its Lightning Bolt on distant and flying attackers. It throws objects only if it can't reach any foes. A flesh guardian possesses a greater sense of self-preservation than most guardians. It avoids fire when it can and may retreat from a battle to save itself." }
