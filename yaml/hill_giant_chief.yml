    - { name: Greatclub, desc: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it makes a DC 16 Strength saving throw, falling prone on a failure.' }
    - { name: Rock, desc: 'Ranged Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, range 60/240 ft., one target. Hit: 26 (6d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it makes a DC 16 Strength saving throw, falling prone on a failure. In lieu of a rock, the giant can throw a grappled Medium or smaller creature up to 30 feet. On a hit, the target and the thrown creature both take 15 (3d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. On a miss, only the thrown creature takes the damage. The thrown creature falls prone in an unoccupied space 5 feet from the target.' }
    - { name: 'Greatclub Sweep (1/Day, While Bloodied)', desc: 'Each creature within 10 feet makes a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage, is pushed 10 feet away from the giant, and falls prone.' }
'bonus actions':
    - { name: Grab, desc: "One creature within 5 feet makes a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it is grappled (escape DC 16). Until this grapple ends, the giant can't grab another target, and it makes greatclub attacks with advantage against the grappled target." }
    - { name: 'Body Slam (1/Day)', desc: 'The giant jumps up to 15 feet horizontally without provoking opportunity attacks and falls prone in a space containing one or more creatures. Each creature in its space when it lands makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 19 (3d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage and falling prone on a failure. On a success, the creature takes half damage and is pushed 5 feet to an unoccupied space of its choice. If that space is occupied, the creature falls prone.' }
    - { name: 'Muddy Ground (1/Day)', desc: "Areas of unworked earth within 60 feet magically become swampy mud for 1 minute or until the giant dies. These areas become difficult terrain. Prone creatures in the area when the mud appears or that fall prone in the area make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the creature's Speed drops to 0 as it becomes stuck in the mud. A creature can use its action to make a DC 15 Strength check, freeing itself on a success." }
    - { name: 'Stomp (1/Day)', desc: 'The giant stamps its foot, causing the ground to tremble. Each creature within 60 feet makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, it falls prone.' }
combat:
    - { name: 'The giant uses its greatclub and grabs opponents whenever it can', desc: "When it has a creature grabbed, it's not always clever enough to focus its attacks on that target. The giant might surrender if it's damaged by a particularly flashy magical effect while it's bloodied." }
