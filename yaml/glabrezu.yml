If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 17). The glabrezu has two pincers, each of which can grapple one target.

It remains for 1 minute, until the glabrezu dismisses it, or until the glabrezu uses this ability again. A creature with darkvision can't see through this darkness, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it." }
    - { name: 'Confusion (1/Day)', desc: 'The glabrezu targets up to three creatures within 90 feet. Each target makes a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw, becoming confused for 1 minute on a failure. A target repeats this saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.' }
combat:
    - { name: 'The glabrezu opens combat with two pincer attacks on the same target', desc: 'It uses Rend whenever it can. It uses Confusion to disrupt ranged attackers. When surrounded by melee attackers, it uses Darkness, relying on its truesight to fight at an advantage. The glabrezu fights until it believes it has no chance of victory, and then offers treasure and favors in exchange for a cease fire.' }
