    - { name: Fork, desc: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (2d6 + 5) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage.' }
    - { name: Tail, desc: 'Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (1d10 + 5) piercing damage. If the target is a creature other than an undead or construct, it makes a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, it receives an infernal wound and takes 11 (2d10) ongoing piercing damage. Each time the devil hits the wounded target with this attack, the ongoing damage increases by 11 (2d10). A creature can spend an action to make a DC 12 Medicine check, ending the ongoing damage on a success. At least 1 hit point of magical healing also ends the ongoing damage.' }
    - { name: 'Hurl Flame', desc: 'Ranged Spell Attack: +7 to hit, range 150 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (3d6) fire damage. If the target is an unattended flammable object or a creature, it catches fire, taking 5 (1d10) ongoing fire damage. A creature can use an action to extinguish this fire.' }

reactions:
    - { name: 'Pin (1/Day)', desc: "When a creature misses the devil with a melee attack, the devil makes a fork attack against that creature. On a hit, the target is impaled by the fork and grappled (escape DC 17). Until this grapple ends, the devil can't make fork attacks or use Inferno, but the target takes 7 (2d6) piercing damage plus 3 (1d6) fire damage at the beginning of each of its turns." }
combat:
    - { name: 'The horned devil prefers to fight in melee, especially against weak enemies', desc: "It goads a ranged creature into making a melee attack, pins it, and keeps it pinned while hurling flame at other opponents. If fighting a melee combatant, the devil tries to pin the creature while 10 feet away from it, so that the creature can't counterattack. When bloodied, it releases a pinned opponent in order to use Inferno. The horned devil follows orders to the letter and rarely retreats, but it might agree to a ceasefire if its orders aren't specific." }
