traits:
    - { name: 'Magic Eater', desc: "Yobbos figure all magic works the sameway that magic potions do. As such, they devour spellcomponents, spell scrolls, and magical trinketsalikewhen they are made aware of them. Yobbos instinctivelyknow which creatures have magic items onthem. When they successfully grab a creature, theyuse their next action to take that creature's nearestmagic item and then stuff it down their throats. Ifit is a weapon, it deals damage to them as if they'dbeen hit by that weapon. If it's a piece of armor, theirmouths stretch to fit around it. They are now imbuedwith the powers of the devoured magic item." }

actions:
    - { name: Mangler, desc: "Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (2d4 + 2) slashing damage.

combat:
    - { name: 'Goblins attack only when they outnumber their opponents', desc: 'They employ ambush, firing arrows from hiding and then using Nimble Escape to hide elsewhere. When they can, they turn an aspect of the battle to their advantage, attacking in darkness or from above or amongst traps and hazards. If a goblin is engaged in melee while not in an advantageous position, it attacks with its shortsword and then disengages. Unless a powerful leader forces them to stand their ground, goblins retreat once they no longer outnumber their enemy.' }
